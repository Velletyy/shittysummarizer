# shittysummarizer
cuz garmothy not working

put .exe in grindreports folder
run .exe whenever to see a summary of your trash/hr and trash/minute. (also your best hour for each location)

- no agris detection
- no yellow/blue detection
- only shows trash loot, nothing else.
- its just extracting the raw number(s) from the .json files
- not every grind spot is supported but can be added very easily in the code
- future proof? doubt.

Simply made to make optimizing paths easier without having to stare at the screen and having a general idea.
Yes, u can technically just look in the .json files manually. But thats annoying and time consuming.
